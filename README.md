# OCaml-Blackjack

This repository contains the source code to run a functional-programming version of Blackjack. 

This project served as a final project for CS 3110: Data Structures and Functional Programming (taught by Michael Clarkson) in the Fall '20 semester and was created by myself, Austin Hochman, and Abby Levin.
